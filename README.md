# Galactic Watcher

## Project Description:

The aim of this project is to create a solar system simulator using the C++ programming language with a CLI interface.

### Expected Features:

**Modeling Celestial Objects**: Creation of each celestial object in the solar system, including planets, moons, and the sun. Each class should include attributes such as mass, radius, orbital period, etc.

**Calculating Orbital Trajectories**: Implementation of algorithms to calculate realistic orbital trajectories of planets and moons based on their mass, orbital velocity, and gravity.

**Simulating Movements**: Using the calculated orbital trajectories, it will simulate the movements of celestial objects throughout the solar system while accounting for gravity and gravitational interactions.

**User Interactivity**: Users should be able to interact with the simulator by performing actions such as selecting an object to display detailed information, changing perspective, or modifying simulation parameters.

**Information about Celestial Objects**: Students will include features allowing users to obtain detailed information about each celestial object, such as distance from the sun, orbital period, etc.


The goal of this mini-project, is to understand C++ inheritances, polymorphisms, and other C++ paradigms. Feel free to add any features you want !
